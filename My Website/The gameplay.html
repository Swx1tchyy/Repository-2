      Players are able to run and crouch behind objects to avoid their pursuers,
      prone beneath obstacles, as well as hide within various places, whether it
      be a barrel, locker, tall grass or a pool of water. There is a limited
      sprint mechanic, which will decrease player character's stamina over time.
      The movement system was also reworked allowing players to slide when
      running. Players can restore health by bandaging their wounds. This,
      however, takes a few seconds and can be disrupted by nearby enemies. The
      Camcorder makes its return with a slightly different HUD and overall
      appearance and can be used to record unfolding events within Temple Gate.
      All acquired recordings can be played back with the addition of Blake's
      commentary over them. Its night vision feature can be implemented to help
      the player navigate through darkness, however batteries are required to
      keep the camera running and will deplete faster as a result of prolonged
      night vision usage. Additionally, the camcorder comes with sound detectors
      for both left and right channels used for locating nearby enemies that are
      otherwise visually obscured.
